      I'm a full-time dad, librarian, and anthropologist living in Southern
      California.

        The source of my greatest fulfillment and joy - and the greatest use of
        my energy and resources - is raising my three kids. Through them, I've
        also learned the joy of cooking and sleeping. My primary concern is
        raising them well.

        I run <a href="https://www.theparkdb.com/">The Park Database</a>, an
        online museum and library for leisure and entertainment attractions. As
        a consultant in this line of work, I've advised developers, movie
        studios, conglomerates, and governments.
        <ul>

            <strong>Some realized projects:</strong> Legoland Korea, Studio City
            Macau, Grand Wilshire Los Angeles, Cosmopolitan Resort Las Vegas,
            Kidzania Doha, Kidzania Seoul, and Kidzania Singapore.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Some unrealized projects:</strong> a spherical floating
            casino, a resort made entirely of marble, an assault-weapons theme
            park, a theme park in the shape of a guitar, a new metropolis where
            transport would be via canals, some living zoos.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        I wrote the only book on theme park manias. This is a rarely talked
        about phenomenon when people of a country collectively lose their minds
        over theme parks.
      </li>

        I did a stint as an analyst at a long-short Asian equity hedge fund.
        After almost two years untangling layers of subsidiaries and assets in
        family-owned enterprises, SOEs, and REITs all across Hong Kong, Korea,
        Singapore, and China, my flash of insight was to buy the FAANGs instead.
        I left, and I did.
      </li>
      <li>
        I spent my early career in real estate in Los Angeles pre-GFC. After the
        crash, I personally made over 5,000 residential and commercial property
        tax appeals in California with roll value reductions of around $1
        billion.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've lived in Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Philadelphia, Hong Kong, Seoul,
        and Taipei. I spent much of my adult life outside the US living and
        traveling; one of my greatest pleasures in moving back was rediscovering
        the existence of clothes dryers and good Mexican food.
      </li>
      <li>I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley.</li>
